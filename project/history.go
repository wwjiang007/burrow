		"0.21.0 - 2018-08-21",
		`### Changed
- Upgraded to Tendermint 0.23.0
- Validator Set Power now takes Address
- RPC/TM config renamed to RPC/Info

### Added
- Burrow deploy creates devdoc
- Docker image has org.label-schema labels

### Fixed
- Upgrade to IAVL 0.10.0 and load previous versions immutably on boot - for chains with a long history > 20 minute load times could be observed because every previous root was being loaded from DB rather than lightweight version references as was intended
- Metrics server does not panic on empty block metas and recovers from other panics
`,
		"0.20.1 - 2018-08-17",
		`### Changed
- The snatives functions have new signatures; string arguments are now string, not byte32.
- The Solidity interface contracts can be generated using the "burrow snatives" command, and the make snatives target is gone.

### Fixed
- TxExecutions that were exceptions (for example those that were REVERTed) will no longer have their events emitted from ExecutionEventsServer.GetEvents. They remain stored in state for the time being.
- CallTxSim and CallCodeSim now take same code path as real transactions (via CallContext)
- Release our mempool signing lock once transactions have been CheckTx'd' to massively increase throughput.

### Added
- Upgraded to Tendermint [0.22.8](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/compare/v0.22.4...v0.22.8) (from 0.22.4).
- Support mempool signing for BroadcastTxAsync.
- Reload log file (e.g. for logrotate) on SIGHUP and dump capture logs on SIGUSR1 and on shutdown (e.g. for debug).
- File logger accepts {{.Timestamp}} in file names to generate a log file per run.
- Ability to set --external-address on burrow configure and burrow start
- Ability to set various command line options on burrow configure and burrow start and by BURROW_ prefixed environment variables
- Exposed Tendermint SeedMode option

		"0.20.0 - 2018-07-24",
		`This is a major (pre-1.0.0) release that introduces the ability to change the validator set through GovTx, transaction execution history, and fuller GRPC endpoint.

#### Breaking changes
- Address format has been changed (by Tendermint and we have followed suite) - conversion is possible but simpler to regenerated keys
- JSON-RPC interface has been removed
- burrow-client has been removed
- rpc/TM methods for events and broadcast have been removed

#### Features
- Tendermint 0.24.4
- GovTx GRPC service. The validator set can be now be changed.
- Enhanced GRPC services: NameReg, Transaction index, blocks service
- Events GRPC service
- Transaction Service can set value transferred

#### Improvements
- The output of "burrow keys export" can be templated

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed panic on nil bounds for blocks service

`,
		"0.19.0 - 2018-06-26",
		`This is a major (pre-1.0.0) release that brings upgrades, safety improvements, cloud configuration, and GRPC endpoints to Burrow.

#### Breaking changes
In addition to breaking changes associated with Tendermint (see their changelog):
- State checkpointing logic has changed which has we load based on blockchain
- Event format has changed over rpc/V0 see execution/events/ package
- On-disk keys format has change from monax-keys to be more standard burrow keys
- Address format has been changed (by Tendermint and we have followed suite) - conversion is possible but simpler to regenerated keys

#### Features
- Tendermint 0.21.0
- Implemented EVM opcodes: REVERT, INVALID, SHL, SAR, SHR, RETURNDATACOPY, RETURNDATASIZE
- Add config templating with burrow configure --config-template-in --config-out
- Add config templates for kubernetes
- Integrate monax-keys as internal (default) or standalone keys service, key gen exposed over CLI

- Maintain separate read-only tree in state so that long-running RPC request cannot block writes
- Improve state safety
- Improved input account server-side-signing
- Increase subscription reap time on rpc/V0 to 20 seconds
- Reorganise CLI
- Improve internal serialisation
- Refactor and modularise execution logic

#### Bug fixes

		"0.18.1",
		`This is a minor release including:
- Introduce InputAccount param for RPC/v0 for integration in JS libs
- Resolve some issues with RPC/tm tests swallowing timeouts and not dealing with reordered events`,
		"0.18.0 - 2018-05-09",
		`This is an extremely large release in terms of lines of code changed addressing several years of technical debt. Despite this efforts were made to maintain external interfaces as much as possible and an extended period of stabilisation has taken place on develop.

A major strand of work has been in condensing previous Monax tooling spread across multiple repos into just two. The Hyperledger Burrow repo and [Bosmarmot](http://github.com/monax/bosmarmot). Burrow is now able to generate chains (replacing 'monax chains make') with 'burrow spec' and 'burrow configure'. Our 'EPM' contract deployment and testing tool, our javascript libraries, compilers, and monax-keys are avaiable in Bosmarmot (the former in the 'bos' tool). Work is underway to pull monax-keys into the Burrow project, and we will continue to make Burrow as self-contained as possible.

#### Features
- Substantial support for latest EVM and solidity 0.4.21+ (missing some opcodes that will be added shortly - see known issues)
- Tendermint 0.18.0
- All signing through monax-keys KeyClient connection (preparation for HSM and GPG based signing daemon)
- Address-based signing (Burrow acts as delegate when you send transact, transactAndHold, send, sendAndHold, and transactNameReg a parameter including input_account (hex address) instead of priv_key.
- Provide sequential signing when using transact family methods (above) - allowing 100s Tx per second with the same input account
- Genesis making, config making, and key generation through 'burrow spec' and 'burrow configure'
- Logging configuration language and text/template for output
- Improved CLI UX and framework (mow.cli)
- Improved configuration


#### Internal Improvements
- Refactored execution and provide interfaces for executor
- Segregate EVM and blockchain state to act as better library
- Panic recovery on TX execution
- Stricter interface boundaries and immutability of core objects by default
- Replace broken BlockCache with universal StateCache that doesn't write directly to DB
- All dependencies upgraded, notably: tendermint/IAVL 0.7.0
- Use Go dep instead of glide
- PubSub event hub with query language
- Heavily optimised logging
- PPROF profiling server option
- Additional tests in multiple packages including v0 RPC and concurrency-focussed test
- Use Tendermint verifier for PrivValidator
- Use monax/relic for project history
- Run bosmarmot integration tests in CI
- Update documentation
- Numerous maintainability, naming, and aesthetic code improvements

#### Bug fixes
- Fix memory leak in BlockCache
- Fix CPU usage in BlockCache
- Fix SIGNEXTEND for negative numbers
- Fix multiple execution level panics
- Make Transactor work during tendermint recheck

#### Known issues
- Documentation rot - some effort has been made to update documentation to represent the current state but in some places it has slipped help can be found (and would be welcomed) on: [Hyperledger Burrow Chat](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow)
- Missing support for: RETURNDATACOPY and RETURNDATASIZE https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/705 (coming very soon)
- Missing support for: INVALID https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/705 (coming very soon)
- Missing support for: REVERT https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/600 (coming very soon)

		"0.17.1",
		`Minor tweaks to docker build file`,

		"0.17.0 - 2017-09-04",
		`This is a service release with some significant ethereum/solidity compatibility improvements and new logging features. It includes:

- [Upgrade to use Tendermint v0.9.2](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/595)
- [Implemented dynamic memory](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/607) assumed by the EVM bytecode produce by solidity, fixing various issues.
- Logging sinks and configuration - providing a flexible mechanism for configuring log flows and outputs see [logging section in readme](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow#logging). Various other logging enhancements.
- Fix event unsubscription
- Remove module-specific versioning
- Rename suicide to selfdestruct
- SNative tweaks

Known issues:

- SELFDESTRUCT opcode causes a panic when an account is removed. A [fix](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/605) was produced but was [reverted](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/636) pending investigation of a possible regression.`,

		"0.16.3 - 2017-04-25",
		`This release adds an stop-gap fix to the Transact method so that it never
transfers value with the CallTx is generates.

We hard-code amount = fee so that no value is transferred
regardless of fee sent. This fixes an invalid jump destination error arising
from transferring value to non-payable functions with newer versions of solidity.
By doing this we can resolve some issues with users of the v0 RPC without making
a breaking API change.`,

		"0.16.2 - 2017-04-20",
		`This release finalises our accession to the Hyperledger project and updates our root package namespace to github.com/hyperledger/burrow.

It also includes a bug fix for rpc/V0 so that BroadcastTx can accept any transaction type and various pieces of internal clean-up.`,

		"0.16.1 - 2017-04-04",
		`This release was an internal rename to 'Burrow' with some minor other attendant clean up.`,

		"0.16.0 - 2017-03-01",
		`This is a consolidation release that fixes various bugs and improves elements
of the architecture across the Monax Platform to support a quicker release
